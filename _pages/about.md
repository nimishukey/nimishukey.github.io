<h2 id="biography"> About </h2>
I have successfully completed my doctoral studies in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering) at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) (*UNSW*) under the guidance of Dr. [Zhengyi Yang](http://www.zhengyi.one/), Assoc. Prof. [Binghao Li](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/binghao-li), Prof. [Wenjie Zhang](https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~zhangw/), and Prof. [Serkan Saydam](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/serkan-saydam) in the [Data and Knowledge Research group](https://unswdb.github.io/) (*DKR*) and the [Mine Internet of Things and Indoor Positioning Indoor Navigation Lab](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/minerals-and-energy-resources-engineering/our-research/facilities/miot-ipin-lab) (MIoT & IPIN).
